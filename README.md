# [Project 1: Data Science Ames Housing Data](https://github.com/) 

* I will build some linear regression models to predict housing prices from Dean De Cock Truman State University Journal of Statistics Education Volume 19, Number 3(2011), www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf . In particular, I will set out to improve on a baseline set of features via feature engineering: deriving new features from our existing data. Feature engineering often makes the difference between a weak model and a strong one. I will use visual exploration, domain understanding, and intuition to construct new features.
