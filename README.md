# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing Data Science and Data Analytics projects. 

## Machine Learning with Python
### [Project 1: How to Identify Potential Cross-sell And Up-sell Customers?](https://github.com/harjomand/Portfolio/blob/main/How%20to%20Identify%20Potential%20Cross-sell%20And%20Up-sell%20Customers.ipynb) 
* Explanatory data analytics , Feature Engineering , Supervised Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree,Random Forest). 

* Results: The benchmark was Logistic regression and it produced 0.7694 AUC on Test dataset. By utilizing the Random Forest and hyper tuning the parameters, the 0.8025 AUC was achieved. So, the hyper tuning results a better performance.

* Techniques: 
   - Supervised Machine Learning : Logistic Regression, Decision Tree,Random Forest
* Tools : 
   - **Python**: Pandas,Numpy,Sklearn,Matplotlib,Seaborn

## Multilayer Perceptrons with Python
### [Project 2: How to Identify Potential Cross-sell And Up-sell Customers?](https://github.com/harjomand/Portfolio/blob/main/MLP.ipynb) 
* Explanatory data analytics , Feature Engineering , MLP 

* Results: The benchmark was 0.7694 for this project. The MLP model beat the benchmark but did not beat the Random Forest.

* Techniques: 
   - Neural Networks
* Tools : 
   - **Python**: Pandas,Numpy,Sklearn,Matplotlib,Seaborn,Keras

## Multivariate Analysis for High-Dimensional Data with R
### [Project 2: Multivariate Analysis - Percentage of Employment in Different Industries By Different Regions](https://github.com/) 
* Applying MANOVA, PCA Analysis, Factor Analysis and Parallel analysis on dependent variables which measure the percentage employment within different employment sectors. The independent variable is Group which is a factor that represents the country regions. 
* Results: 

* Techniques: 
   - Multivariate Analysis Of Variance (MANOVA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis, and Parallel Analysis 
* Tools : 
   - **R**: MVN,car, and psych

### [Project 2: Multivariate Analysis - Analysing The Relationship Between Student's Psychological Variables and Their Academic Grades](https://github.com/) 
* Multivariate Analysis for High-Dimensional Data . Applying Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) , Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) , and Cluster Analysis on the Dataset. 
* Results: I realized that there are a range of correlations (all positive) within and between psychological and the academic variables sets. They all have moderate correlation.Also, we realized that students who have less
control and motivation are associated with students who have low academics in english , maths , history and biology. But the analysis really has not been that successful and possibly those initial correlation matrices should warn us because we had a lot of really low correlation in the Psychological matrix which was a concern. Its possible that our assumption of MVN was a mistake and maybe if we test, it wonâ€™t fit a Multivariate normality.

* Techniques: 
   - Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) , Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) , and Cluster Analysis
* Tools : 
   - **R**: yacca,lattice,caret,MASS, and ade4
