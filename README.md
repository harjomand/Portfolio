Repository containing Data Science and Data Analytics projects. 

## Machine Learning & Deep Learning - Python
### [Project 1: How to Identify Potential Cross-sell And Up-sell Customers?](https://github.com/harjomand/Portfolio/blob/main/How_to_Identify_Potential_Cross_sell_And_Up_sell_Customers.ipynb) 
* Explanatory data analytics, Feature Engineering, Feature Importance, Supervised Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) in Keras, K-means, Autoencoder in Pytorch, and PCA .   
* Benchmar: The benchmark was Logistic regression and it produced 0.7694 AUC on Test dataset.
* Results: By utilizing Random Forest and hyper tuning the parameters, the 0.8025 AUC was achieved. 

* Techniques: 
   - Supervised Machine Learning : Logistic Regression, Decision Tree,Random Forest,
   - Deep Learning : Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP),
   - Unsupervised Machine Learning : K-means, 
   - Principal Components Analysis (PCA), and
   - Autoencoder
