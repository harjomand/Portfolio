# Portfolio
Data Science Portfolio. Repository containing Data Science and Data Analytics projects. 

## Machine Learning with Python
### [Project 1: Predict House Sale Prices in Ames, Iowa](https://github.com/) 
* Feature Engineering . Predicting housing prices via linear regression models. The Data is from Dean De Cock Truman State University Journal of Statistics Education Volume 19, Number 3(2011), www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf. 


## Data Analysis with R
### [Project 1: Multivariate Analysis - Percentage of Employment in Different Industries By Different Regions](https://github.com/) 
* Multivariate Analysis for High-Dimensional Data . Applying MANOVA, PCA Analysis, Factor Analysis and Parallel analysis on dependent variables which measure the percentage employment within different employment sectors. The independent variable is Group which is a factor that represents the country regions. 

* Techniques: 
   - Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis, and Parallel Analysis 
* Tools : 
   - **R**: MVN,car, and psych

### [Project 2: Multivariate Analysis - Analysing The Relationship Between Student's Psychological Variables and Their Academic Grades](https://github.com/) 
* Multivariate Analysis for High-Dimensional Data . Applying Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) , Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) , and Cluster Analysis on the Dataset. 
* I realized that there are a range of correlations (all positive) within and between psychological and the academic variables sets. They all have moderate correlation.Also, we realized that students who have less
control and motivation are associated with students who have low academics in english , maths , history and
biology. But the analysis really has not been that successful and possibly those initial correlation matrices
should warn us because we had a lot of really low correlation in the Psychological matrix which was a concern.
Its possible that our assumption of MVN was a mistake and maybe if we test, it wonâ€™t fit a Multivariate
normality.

* Techniques: 
   - Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) , Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) , and Cluster Analysis
* Tools : 
   - **R**: yacca,lattice,caret,MASS, and ade4

## Simulation 
### [Project 1: Express Checkout Simulation](https://github.com/harjomand/Portfolio/blob/main/Express%20Checkout%20Simulation%20with%20Python%20.ipynb)
* Simulating a real-world scenario with Python: Comparing different checkout configuration and providing recommendation on the quickest checkout service.
* Tools: 
   - **Python**: modsim
