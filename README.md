# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing Data Science and Data Analytics projects. 

## Machine Learning & Deep Learning - Python
### [Project 1: How to Identify Potential Cross-sell And Up-sell Customers?](https://github.com/harjomand/Portfolio/blob/main/How_to_Identify_Potential_Cross_sell_And_Up_sell_Customers.ipynb) 
* Explanatory data analytics, Feature Engineering, Feature Importance, Supervised Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) in Keras, K-means, Autoencoder in Pytorch, and PCA .   
* Benchmar: The benchmark was Logistic regression and it produced 0.7694 AUC on Test dataset.
* Results: By utilizing Random Forest and hyper tuning the parameters, the 0.8025 AUC was achieved. 

* Techniques: 
   - Supervised Machine Learning : Logistic Regression, Decision Tree,Random Forest,
   - Deep Learning : Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP),
   - Unsupervised Machine Learning : K-means, 
   - Principal Components Analysis (PCA), and
   - Autoencoder
   
* Tools: 
   - **Python**: Pandas,Numpy,Sklearn,Matplotlib,Seaborn,Keras,and Pytorch

## Multivariate Analysis for High-Dimensional Data with R
### [Project 2: Multivariate Analysis - Percentage of Employment in Different Industries By Different Regions](https://github.com/harjomand/Portfolio/blob/main/Analysing-Eurogroup.pdf) 
* Applying MANOVA, PCA Analysis, Factor Analysis and Parallel analysis on dependent variables which measure the percentage employment within different employment sectors. The independent variable is Group which is a factor that represents the country regions. 
* Results: 

* Techniques: 
   - Multivariate Analysis Of Variance (MANOVA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis, and Parallel Analysis 
* Tools : 
   - **R**: MVN,car, and psych

## Multivariate Analysis for High-Dimensional Data with R
### [Project 3: Multivariate Analysis - Analysing The Relationship Between Student's Psychological Variables and Their Academic Grades](https://github.com/) 
* Multivariate Analysis for High-Dimensional Data . Applying Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) , Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) , and Cluster Analysis on the Dataset. 
* Results: I realized that there are a range of correlations (all positive) within and between psychological and the academic variables sets. They all have moderate correlation.Also, we realized that students who have less
control and motivation are associated with students who have low academics in english , maths , history and biology. But the analysis really has not been that successful and possibly those initial correlation matrices should warn us because we had a lot of really low correlation in the Psychological matrix which was a concern. Its possible that our assumption of MVN was a mistake and maybe if we test, it wonâ€™t fit a Multivariate normality.

* Techniques: 
   - Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) , Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) , and Cluster Analysis
* Tools : 
   - **R**: yacca,lattice,caret,MASS, and ade4
